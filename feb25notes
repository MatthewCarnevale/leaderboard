wanna clean up database stuff and make foreign key relations + update statements
gonna need to make a branch and risk a lot of damage
shouldn't push all this to main postgres db should use local one instead


timetracker should be using update not insert, otherwise its good
new foreign key tables are created need to implement them into code
match history needs to be inserted
lifetime should be updated
daily should be updated
data idk might need a few rows?
data should be able to be updated i think

naming changes
lifetime = life
matchhistory = history
NEW players
dailylp = daily
playerdata = data


CREATE TABLE players( name character varying, CONSTRAINT players_pkey PRIMARY KEY (name))

CREATE TABLE daily(name character varying, date date,lp integer,totalgames integer,yesterdaysdelta integer,CONSTRAINT daily_pkey PRIMARY KEY (name),CONSTRAINT name FOREIGN KEY (name)REFERENCES players (name) MATCH SIMPLE)
